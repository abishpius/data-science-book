## Why this Tutorial?

Most Data Science books are written for computer scientists. This one is different. It's written for the **Excel expert**, the **Financial Analyst**, and the **Business Professional** who knows their industry but wants to scale their impact with code.

### What you will learn:

- **Phase 1: Foundations** - Moving from cells to variables and setting up your environment.
- **Phase 2: Wrangling** - Mastering Pandas to clean and manipulate millions of rows.
- **Phase 3: Visuals** - Using the "Grammar of Graphics" to tell stories with data.
- **Phase 4: Intelligence** - Implementing Machine Learning for prediction and classification.
- **Phase 5: Strategy** - Communicating results through Executive Summaries and ROI.
